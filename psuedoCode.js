//Pull It Together App

//A command line app that generates a PDF populated with 

//GitHub API

// the baground color for the pdf should match the user specified color

//DONE create inquirer question to get username, favorite color, 
//DONE run the api call
//DONE when I get the response save the required info to variables

//PROVIDED create a template literal for an HTML page that plugs in all the variables from the API call
//DONE - ISH link the template literal to the index.js populate it with the appropriate variables

//write those variables to a pdf file with the favorite color as the background



// DONE GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.


// The application generates a PDF resume from the user provided GitHub profile.


// DONE The generated resume includes a bio image from the user's GitHub profile.


// DONE The generated resume includes the user's location 
// DONE and a link to their GitHub profile.


// The background color of the generated PDF matches the color that the user provides.
// https://api.github.com/users/AdenasGittinIt/repos - loop through this api and get the sumation of all stargazer counts

//User location via Google Maps - GET CLARIFICATION ON THIS!!

//I'll have to append the href to buttons on the HTML
//I'll need to confirm that that is working.


// Right now my APIs are functioning as expected. 
// The response from each API is populating an object. 
// DONE I need to plug in the values from the returned object to my HTLM template literal
// DONE I need to use fs write file to create the HTML file.
// DONE once the html file is created I need to convert it and write it to a pdf file

//I think everything is on my PDF... just need to style it.
